# Clair Agent

The end goal: build **Clairvoyant (Clair) Agent**: an open-source agent that wakes up every morning, scans arXiv / X / HN / Reddit / HuggingFace, picks the 5 real trends, writes a viral thread in my calm/classic voice, analyzes my posting history, and optionally auto-posts with one-click approval.

Structured into **4-week phases** (28 days each) numbered sequentially.

Key rules:

- Windows only (for now)
- LLM topics mixed from Day 1 (spiral curriculum — never delay LLMs past Day 3)
- Every single day must ship visible code + a public X thread
- Daily time budget: max 120 minutes (usually 60–90) never exceed it. - I'll try to code and post every day but I'll keep it real, life is complicated and we must acknowledge that.
