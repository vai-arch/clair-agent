Here are the three tweets:

Tweet 1: Scaling egocentric manipulation research is challenging due to data heterogeneity. New paper "In-N-On" addresses this by categorizing human data into in-the-wild and on-task datasets, unlocking full potential for scalable learning #EgocentricManipulation #Robotics

Tweet 2: Key insight: Utilizing systematic analysis of in-the-wild and on-task datasets enables more robust manipulation policies through pre-training with diverse data sources. Categorization helps to reduce overfitting and increase generalizability #DeepLearning #DataCuration

Tweet 3: The "In-N-On" paper matters because it provides a foundational framework for scaling egocentric manipulation research, enabling the development of more sophisticated robotic systems that can learn from real-world data in-the-wild. Implications for robotics, AI, and human-robot interaction #RoboticsResearch
