Here are the three tweets about the paper:

Tweet 1: Multimodal foundation models still struggle with spatial intelligence, leading to subpar performance in tasks like image captioning & visual question answering. This paper addresses this issue by scaling up these models.

Tweet 2: The key technical insight is that the authors use a "principled approach" to scale multimodal models, combining Qwen3-VL & InternVL3 with unified understanding & generation models (e.g., Bagel) to create high-performing & robust spatial intelligence models.

Tweet 3: This research matters because it can improve the accuracy of applications like visual search, image retrieval & object recognition, which rely heavily on spatial intelligence. By scaling up multimodal models, we can unlock better performance in these critical areas.
