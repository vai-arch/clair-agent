Here are three tweets about the paper:

Tweet 1:
Fixed horizon choice limits VLA model performance. New study reveals optimal horizons for action chunking, enabling better balance between global foresight & fine-grained control in robotic manipulation tasks.

Tweet 2:
Key finding: longer horizons improve global foresight but degrade accuracy, while shorter ones sharpen local control but struggle on long-term tasks. This trade-off suggests a single horizon choice is suboptimal for VLA models.

Tweet 3:
Mitigating the action chunk length horizon limitation is crucial for advancing VLA models in robotic manipulation. This paper's insights enable more flexible and effective training, paving the way for improved performance on complex tasks.
