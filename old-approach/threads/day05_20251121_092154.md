Here are three tweets about the paper:

Tweet 1:
Egocentric manipulation lacks scalable, high-quality training data. New paper "In-N-On" addresses this by proposing a systematic approach to collect and utilize in-the-wild & on-task egocentric videos for robust policy learning.

Tweet 2:
Key insight: PHSD dataset categorization into in-the-wild & on-task datasets enables more effective pre-training of manipulation policies, leveraging diverse data sources while maintaining task-relevance. #AIresearch

Tweet 3:
Egocentric manipulation research has the potential to revolutionize human-robot interaction & robotics. "In-N-On" paper's scalable recipe for collecting & using egocentric data is a crucial step towards unlocking this full potential. #Robotics #HumanRobotInteraction
