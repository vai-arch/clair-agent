Here are the three tweets about the paper:

Tweet 1:
Scaling manipulation policies from egocentric videos is challenging due to data heterogeneity. This paper addresses this issue by providing a systematic approach for collecting and using in-the-wild & on-task data.

Tweet 2:
The key technical insight in "In-N-On" is that curating PHSD, an egocentric video dataset categorized into in-the-wild & on-task data, enables scalable manipulation policy learning with diverse environments.

Tweet 3:
This paper matters because it unlocks the full potential of egocentric data for manipulation policy learning. By leveraging diverse and task-relevant data, researchers can develop more robust and generalizable AI systems for real-world applications.
