Here are the three tweets about the paper "Mixture of Horizons in Action Chunking":

Tweet 1:
"Robotic manipulation tasks often suffer from action chunk length sensitivity. Our study addresses this issue by exploring an optimal horizon for Vision-Language-Action models, revealing a trade-off between global foresight and fine-grained accuracy."

Tweet 2:
"Key finding: our empirical study demonstrates that a fixed choice of single horizons is suboptimal due to the inherent trade-off between global foresight & fine-grained accuracy. A mixture of horizons provides better performance on VLA tasks."

Tweet 3:
"Their work matters because it tackles the long-standing challenge of action chunk length sensitivity in VLA models, enabling more accurate & effective robotic manipulation. This has significant implications for robotics, computer vision, and human-robot interaction research."
