Here are three tweets about the paper:

Tweet 1:
"New paper tackles scalability of egocentric manipulation! Existing approaches rely on human data for pre-training, but this work presents a systematic approach to collecting & using in-the-wild and on-task datasets, unlocking full potential. #AI #Robotics"

Tweet 2:
"Technical insight: The authors propose categorizing egocentric data into in-the-wild and on-task categories, enabling more efficient use of diverse data sources for pre-training manipulation policies. This helps mitigate data heterogeneity issues. #MachineLearning"

Tweet 3:
"This paper matters because it addresses the significant challenge of scaling egocentric manipulation research using human data. By providing a systematic approach to curating and utilizing in-the-wild and on-task datasets, this work enables more robust and generalizable manipulation policies. #RoboticsResearch"
